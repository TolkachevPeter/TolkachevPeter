### A Little About My Professional Journey

My journey into IT started with an unusual task ‚Äì automating the process of writing scientific texts. When I was engaged in writing scientific publications, I was inspired by the idea of creating a system that could optimize this process, taking a cue from the optimization of translations in Google Translate. This passion led me to programming and the conviction that in the future machines, not humans, will write texts, which will become one of the key ways to pass the Turing test and answer the question, "Can a machine think?".

I love science, and I believe that programmers are the innovators of the 21st century. The self-organization and discipline I acquired while writing my thesis became the key qualities that helped me succeed in this field. I always bring all matters to an end, for many years I managed to work and study at the same time, not taking a single academic leave.

My passion for technology and computers started in childhood with my first computer. Despite the fact that I broke it on the very first day, I fixed it on the second day. This "broke-fixed" experience taught me to figure out technical problems and find solutions.

Thanks to my technical talent, I have equipped my own office with excellent devices, including two iMacs and two MacBook Pros, which makes me fully ready for remote work and productive task execution.

### My Strengths

I have a high level of self-organization and discipline that helped me achieve success in the scientific field and I now apply these qualities in programming. I always set specific goals for myself and pursue their achievement, no matter how complex the path may be.

My scientific career has developed in me the ability for analytical thinking. This allows me to quickly navigate complex tasks and find optimal solutions using available resources.

Speed and precision in work are characteristic of me. Thanks to the experience of writing scientific articles and dissertations, I've learned to formulate thoughts quickly and clearly, which is applicable in both programming and communication within the team.

I am open to new technologies and always ready to learn. My passion for technology, which has been evident since my childhood, assists me in this. I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, and I am always ready to accept new challenges to become even better at what I do.

Thanks to my fully equipped office, I can work remotely and productively, which makes me a flexible and adaptive specialist, ready for any circumstances.
